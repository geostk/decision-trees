# Decision-trees project
## The project
In this project we'll try to implement and learn about decision trees the in artificial intelligence subject _KRU_ (_Knowledge, reasoning and uncertainty_ or in Catalan, a region from Spain we are living: _Coneixement, raonament i incertesa_).

## Goals
For this project, our goals are:
 - Learn about information gain, entropy and big data
 - Understand the algorithms _ID3_ (_Iterative Dichotomiser 3_), _C4.5_ and evaluate them using several sample sets
 - Implement and evaluate the validation test techniques used in big data to measure the accuracy of our classifications
 - Use real data sets to generate knowledge from them as data scientists

## Data sets
We'll use University of California Irvine's sample data sets to test our algorithms:
 - [Mushroom's data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)
 - [Adult's data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
